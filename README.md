## 🎯 Purpose
The SpaceFit landing page was built to:

Showcase my front-end design and development skills

Demonstrate understanding of layout structure and mobile responsiveness

Deliver a simple but effective product showcase website for a sneaker brand

## 🧗‍♂️ Challenges Faced
Ensuring the layout remained consistent across different screen sizes took multiple rounds of media query tweaking and testing.

Aligning product images and texts using Bootstrap grid required some trial and error to make it look uniform on mobile and desktop.

I struggled initially with structuring the layout using Bootstrap rows and columns, especially when trying to balance spacing and responsiveness.

Adding smooth hover effects and interactivity using JavaScript took time to get right without breaking the design.

## 📚 Lessons Learned
I became more confident using Bootstrap 5 grid and utility classes for building responsive layouts.

Improved my skills in organizing files and structuring components cleanly in a front-end project.

Gained hands-on experience with using JavaScript for simple interactivity and learned how it can enhance the user experience.

I also got better at using Git and GitHub, managing commits, pushing updates, and keeping a clean project history.

This project helped me understand how to build landing pages that are not just responsive but also visually appealing and user-friendly.
